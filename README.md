Concept behind Seeker is simple, just like we host phishing pages to get credentials why not host a fake page that requests your location like many popular location based websites. Read more on <a href="https://thewhiteh4t.github.io"> thewhiteh4t's Blog </a>.Seeker Hosts a fake website which asks for Location Permission and if the target allows it, we can get :

* Longitude
* Latitude
* Accuracy
* Altitude - Not always available
* Direction - Only available if user is moving
* Speed - Only available if user is moving

Along with Location Information we also get **Device Information** without any permissions :

* Unique ID using Canvas Fingerprinting
* Device Model - Not always available
* Operating System
* Platform
* Number of CPU Cores - Approximate Results
* Amount of RAM - Approximate Results
* Screen Resolution
* GPU information
* Browser Name and Version
* Public IP Address
* Local IP Address
* Local Port

**Automatic IP Address Reconnaissance** is performed after the above information is received.

**This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only, Seeker shows what data a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you should not click on random links and allow critical permissions such as Location etc.**

## How is this Different from IP GeoLocation

* Other tools and services offer IP Geolocation which is NOT accurate at all and does not give location of
